# Power BI Healthcare Patient-Wait-List Dashboard Project

##Overview
This project focuses on developing a Power BI dashboard to analyze patient waitlist data in the healthcare sector from the years 2018 to 2021. The objective is to track the current status of the patient waiting list, analyze historical monthly trends in inpatient and outpatient categories, and perform a detailed specialty level and age profile analysis.

##Key Functionalities:

Connects to a folder containing patient data (200+ data connectors supported by Power BI).
Transforms and cleanses data using Power Query Editor.
Establishes data relationships and models for efficient analysis.
Creates interactive visualizations (charts & graphs) to display wait list trends.
Implements dynamic and static row-level security for data access control.
Offers customizable dashboards with:
Latest Month Wait List
Previous Year Wait List Comparison
Average vs. Median Wait List (user selectable)
Time Band Analysis (handling missing data)
Detailed Specialty and Age Group Breakdown
Custom Tooltips
